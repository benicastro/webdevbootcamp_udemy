    <p>
      <strong> Comments </strong> are <strong> HTML elements </strong> that we
      write inside of our code and these elements are not visible inside of our
      webpage.
    </p>
    &lt;!-- This is a comment --&gt;
    <p>
      Comments are very useful for creating reminders inside the code for
      yourself or for other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comments are also very useful for debugging code in cases when our code
      doesn't work as it should.
    </p>
    <p>There are two types of comments:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>one line</li>
      <li>multiline</li>
    </ul>
